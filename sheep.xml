               Sheep</head>
            <p>A weak minded <persName corresp="stevensonography.xml#sheep">sheep</persName> and her
               lamb once lived on a bit of barren land; there were several small spots where clover
               grew, and a little shelter of old brush. They were not well cared for, but they made
               the best of what they had, and were reasonably happy. One day a she wolf brought over
               to their place, from her own green fields, several sheep from her flock; they
               devoured all the clover that was the only <subst>
                  <del rend="overstrike">subsistence</del>
                  <add place="supralinear">sustenance</add>
               </subst> of the <persName corresp="stevensonography.xml#sheep">sheep</persName> and
               lamb, and carelessly threw over their shelter of boughs.</p>
            <p>It sounds odd that a she-wolf should have charge of a flock; but this was a wily she-
               wolf; there were many wolves in the forest, and game was scarce and shy, so she got a
               place with a shepherd as a sheepdog. The shepherd was blind, and old, and foolish,
               and never knew the imposture. The neighbours, who were reluctant to meddle in other
               people’s affairs, did not like, or did not choose to tell him; so the she-wolf and
               her cubs waxed fast and strong, while her kinsmen of the forest, gaunt and hungry
               roamed <pb/> about, seeking their prey.</p>
            <p>It was not that she particularly wished to harm the <persName
                  corresp="stevensonography.xml#sheep">sheep</persName> and lamb that the she-wolf
               robbed them, but that her natural instincts inclining her to a guerrilla life
               occasionally overcame the teachings of civilization.</p>
            <p>It was hard upon the <persName corresp="stevensonography.xml#sheep">sheep</persName>
               and the lamb. A cold rain fell, and winter was not far off. Before the clover had
               started to grow again, the shivering lamb was dead. The sheep tried to warm it with
               her own body, but her wool was wet, and she, too, was starved with the cold; she
               could only watch her lamb’s innocent eyes grey, and its little legs stiffen, with a
                  <span ana="stevensonography.xml#grief">breaking heart</span>. She could do
               nothing; she could not replace the shelter, nor could she make the grass grow again,
                  <span ana="stevensonography.xml#gothic">though she would gladly have watered the
                  grass with her blood, and torn the fleece from her back to keep the cold from the
                  lamb.</span></p>
            <p>When the lamb was dead it was thrown into a hole. <span
                  ana="Stevenson_OgraphyV1.xmlstevensonography.xml#grief"
                  corresp="Stevenson_OgraphyV1.xmlstevensonography.xml#sheep">The <persName
                     corresp="stevensonography.xml#sheep">sheep, </persName> in her grief, hoped and
                  thought she might die too; but she was older and stronger and more used to
                  hardship than the lamb, so, sad and lonely, she held on and endured the cold and
                  the hunger. Most of the time she either stood gazing <pb/>at the hole where they
                  had thrown her lamb, or wandered about the bare pasture where it had frisked and
                  played in happier days. Once a cub of the she-wolf came that way; it was so plump,
                  and sleek, and well cared for, that when the <span
                     ana="stevensonography.xml#grief">bereaved sheep</span> looked upon it she felt
                  her weak heart giving way because of the injustice of things, and in <span
                     ana="stevensonography.xml#fear">a mad rage</span> chased the wolf-cub howling
                  away to its mother.</span></p>
            <p>The next day the blind shepherd came in <span ana="stevensonography.xml#fear">a great
                  rage</span> to the <persName corresp="stevensonography.xml#sheep">sheep.
               </persName> The wolf-cub had come panting home with a fearful tale; the <persName
                  corresp="stevensonography.xml#sheep">sheep,</persName> she said, had come at her
               with <span ana="stevensonography.xml#wonder">a mouth a yard wide, full of blood and
                  foam; with eyes the size of dinner plates, from which shot blue and green flames,
                  and with an awful, deafening roar like a wild lion.</span></p>
            <p><span ana="stevensonography.xml#unsure">The <persName
                     corresp="stevensonography.xml#sheep">sheep</persName> could not remember these
                  details, but full of trouble went off alone to think it over</span>; and wondered
               if all this were really true, and she had actually become a <seg
                  corresp="stevensonography.xml#sheep">mad ravening sheep</seg>.</p>
            <p>Soon she met the <persName corresp="stevensonography.xml#haymaker"
                  >Haymaker</persName> who was fond of walking in paths and places where the shadows
               were heavy. He was called the <persName corresp="stevensonography.xml#haymaker"
                  >Haymaker</persName> because he was supposed to make hay while the sun shone. All
               people went to him for advice, he was <pb/>accounted so very wise; he was thought to
               be wise because he had many books, and he looked solemn, and <span
                  ana="stevensonography.xml#wonder"> he often said “policy is better than honesty,”
                  “don’t whistle too much for your pay,” and other things that showed a profound
                  intellect, and a habit of deep thought.</span> When he demanded the reason of the
                  <persName corresp="stevensonography.xml#sheep">sheep’s</persName> depression of
               mind, she, being in awe of so great a man, <said who="stevensonography.xml#sheep"

                  away off to some quiet place where I can be quite alone. There I may be able to
                  recover my former tranquility of mind. As it is, I fear I am in too dangerous a
                  state to be allowed to roam about freely. It is a dreadful thing to find out that
                  one is a ravening sheep. How do I know, or how do you know, to what wild deed my
                  fevered mind may prompt me. Suppose I should suddenly spring upon the wild bull,
                  drag him to <pb/>the ground, and tear his vitals from his quivering body."</said>

            <p>Crushed and humiliated she was carried off to a small paddock by the sea; here she
               nibbled grass on the hillside, and trotted by the beach, and might have become

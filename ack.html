<h4 class="center"> Acknowledgements</h4>

<h5>Encoding the Vandegrifter was made possible thanks to several institutions, organisations, and individuals, particularly the <a href="https://www.cdcs.ed.ac.uk/">Centre for Data, Culture, and Society</a>, at the University of Edinburgh, which provided this project with essential funding. Technical support from <a href="https://edina.ac.uk/">EDINA</a>, in particular Harry Newton and Andrew Horne, has ensured the functionality of this site. Many thanks also go to the <a href="https://stevensonmuseum.org/">Robert Louis Stevenson Museum</a>, in St. Helena, California, for permissions to use images and content from the archives. Without the above assistance, these four manuscripts might have remained in the margins of literary history for much longer.</h6>

<h5>The site is maintained by the Co-Principal Investigators Dr. Robyn Pritzker and <a href="https://aelang.github.io/">Dr. Anouk Lang</a>. Dr. Pritzker has written extensively about Fanny Van de Grift Stevenson, her stories, and the rest of the Stevenson family.</h4>

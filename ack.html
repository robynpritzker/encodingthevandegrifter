<h6>Encoding the Vandegrifter was made possible thanks to several institutions and organisations, particularly the <a href="https://www.cdcs.ed.ac.uk/">Centre for Data, Culture, and Society, at the University of Edinburgh<a/>, which provided this project with essential funding, as well as the <a href="https://stevensonmuseum.org/">Robert Louis Stevenson Museum</a>, in St. Helena, California, without which these four manuscripts might have remained in the margins of literary history for much longer.</h6>

<h4>This site is maintained by Robyn Pritzker, who has written extensively about Fanny Van de Grift Stevenson, her work, and the rest of the Stevenson family. Further acknowledgment goes to Dr. Anouk Lang for administrative and scholarly support, and to the <a href="http://www.dhsi.org/">Digital Humanities Summer Institute</a> for providing training in methods and practices used in the development of this project.</h4>

  <p><span
class="persName">Belinda Smith</span> found herself in a very unpleasant
position. How it happened is not part of this story, which opens with
<span class="persName">Belinda</span> hanging by the belt on a hook in a
giant’s kitchen. </p>
	    <p>The cook was heating water, and sharpening
knives for the evident purpose of preparing the unhappy girl for the
giant’s table, she was just in the act of studying <span
class="persName">Belinda’s</span> length and breadth with an eye to a
dripping pan of the right proportions when the giant
entered.</p>
	    <p><span class="persName">Belinda</span> could see nothing
in her terror but a huge unshapely bulk of frightful aspect.  Really,
however, <span class="persName">the giant</span> possessed a jolly, big
good-humoured stupid face. Jolly people are apt to be a little
stupid.</p>
	    <p><span class="said">“No luck again, today.”</span> He
said, as he came thumping in. <span class="said">“A pretty dish to sit
before the grand Borriballoo, one pitiful child with a spoonful of
gravy; and too late today for any more hunting. Is she nice and
plump?”</span> as he advanced toward the terrified Belinda.</p>
	    <p><span
class="said">“Halloo! What’s this?!"</span>  Stooping to pick up a bit
of paper that had dropped from <span class="persName">Belinda’s</span>
pocket. As he glanced over the note, which was only a wash bill from
Belinda’s mother, who did clearstacking, his countenance changed; he
sighed heavily, and repeated the name
signed to the note several times in a sad and touching voice; then
reached up and unhooked <span class="persName">Belinda</span> whom he
placed upon a table by his side.</p>
	    <p><span class="said">“What is your
name, child?”</span> he asked, in a very different voice from that he
had used when he entered. <span
class="said"><span class="persName">“Belinda Smith,</span> you say? Ah yes, that name I have heard
before. It is truly a sweet name. You would hardly believe now, that a
bluff old fellow like myself had ever been in love? I have. It was your
mother child. Many years ago she fell into my hands much as you have
done; I had intended her for company, but before long she had  
	    <br/><br/><span class="pagebreak">[manuscript page break]</span>
	    <br/><br/> somehow wound
herself into my affections, she implored me to carry her to her father.
I did so. From that day to this I have never beheld her. I know now that
it would have been better to have eaten her as I intended to do, for
then she would have been part of my own being forever. Now it is too
late. Like you, she was very plump,”</span> looking dreamily at <span
class="persName"></span>Belinda.</p>
	    <p><div class="said">“I think, my dear,
for the sake of old times, and the memories of my youth, I will have you
served with my guests instead of to them. Come, I will call <span
class="persName">Lallagagog,</span> my son, to show you to the guest
chamber. Try to rest and sleep well that your eyes may be as bright, and
your cheeks as rosy as your mothers were when I first saw
	    her.”</div></p>
	    <p><span class="persName">Lallagagog</span> came at his father’s call and escorted <span
class="persName">Belinda</span> to her room. He was a saucy awkward lout
of a giant boy and disposed to be sulky at the change in the morrow’s
bill of fare.</p>
	    <p><span class="persName">Belinda</span> was too tired
to think of the strange things that had occurred, and begging <span class="persName">Lallagagog</span> to reach
a pillow for her from the immense bed,she lay down upon it and
slept until daybreak. In the morning it was some time before she could
recall her scattered senses enough to recollect her whereabouts; but
<span class="persName">Lallagagog’s</span> hoarse voice <span
class="indirectsaid">calling her to breakfast,</span> warned her to be in
haste. She dressed rapidly and stepped into the hall where <span
class="persName">the giant</span> was waiting for her. He led her into
the breakfast room. A box had been placed upon a chair for her and the
giant lifted her to her place. Her acutest fears now began to dissipate,
and she ate her breakfast with a good appetite, and even <span
class="indirectsaid">carried on a conversation</span> with <span class="persName">the giant</span> with some
diplomacy, giving full accounts of all the members of the Smith
familythat she knew anything about, especially of those who had
become famous or possessed much political influence, hoping that the

	    <br/><br/><span class="pagebreak">[manuscript page break]</span>
	    <br/><br> <span
class="persName">giant</span> might have some fear of incurring the
enmity of so great and influential a race.</p>
	    <p>The giant listened
politely, and looked impressed by what she had said. Suddenly a bright
idea seemed to strike him.</p>
	    <p><span class="said"><span class="persName">“Belinda,”</span></span> said he kindly, <span
class="said">“How old are you?"</span></p><div
class="said">“Fifteen.”</div>
	    <p><span
class="said">“My grandmother was married at fifteen,”
		    remarked <span class="persName">the giant.</span></span></p>
	    <p><span
class="said">“Was she
		    indeed?”/<span> said <span class "persName">Belinda,</span> not knowing what else to say.</p>
	    <p><span
class="said"><span
		   class="persName">“Belinda,”</span></span> more kindly still, “How would you
like to be married?”</span></p>
	    <p>A horrible fear took possession of <span
class="persName">Belinda.</span> Perhaps he wished to marry her himself.
He must be a widower, she had seen no woman, yet, about the house but
the cook, and for all she knew, giants might, anyhow, have as many wives
as old <a class="link_ref"
href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Brigham-Young">Brigham.</a></
p>
	    <p><span
		     class="said">“I—I don’t—know”</span> faltered poor <span
class="persName">Belinda,</span> bursting into tears.</p>
	    <p><span
class="said">“Tut, tut,
		    Pshaw!”</span> said <span class="persName">the giant</span> in not so kind a
voice as before. <span
class="said">“I’m not going to eat you, what are you crying
		    for?”</span></p>
	    <p>The cry was swallowed instantly, as <span
class="persName">Belinda</span> made haste to answer <span
class="said">“I never thought of
		    such a thing, I assure you! What were you about to say, please?”</span> with a
sickly attempt to smile.</p>
            <p><span
		     class="said">“Only this,”</span> said <span
class="persName">the giant,</span> <span
class="said">“that I am going to have company
		    today to dinner; a personnage of great importance;”</span> his voice took a
deeper tone. <span
class="said">“His Highness the <span class="persName">Grand
Borriballoo!</span> It is to be quite an affair as it is only a business
interview he seeks. I,"</span> and he swelled with conscious pride, <span
class="said">“am
Confidential Matrimonial Adviser to his highness! Of course a personage
of his rank could not take the trouble to choose a wife for himself.
		    That is my affair.</span>
	    <br/><span class="pagebreak">[manuscript page break]</span>
	    <br/><span
class="said">I have been in
much perplexity because I could not fix upon an eligible party, when it
suddenly occurred to me, why not <span class="persName">Belinda?</span>
You are certainly of a good family, belonging to a long line of Smiths.
And being a protegee of mine gives you standing. Indeed, I consider it a
very suitable match on both sides. Now, my dear, just think this matter
		    over. At four precisely I will come for your decision.”</span> Bowing politely
he left the room.</p>
	    <p>Belinda was in a whirl of agitation. What a
brilliant future was before her! The <span
class="persName">Borriballoo,</span> might, to be sure, be as old and
ugly as the giant himself: but the bliss of being “My Lady Borriballoo”
covered any unpleasant suggestions that arose in her mind. An occasional
thought of the red headed boy, who sat next to her at school, and to
whom she had been engaged for the past three weeks came to her
remembrance once or twice, but was soon forgotten. What chance had a red
headed boy beside the <span
class="persName">grand Borriballoo.</span></p>
	    <p><span
class="persName">Belinda</span> had one ugly habit of which I am loth to
speak. She was very apt to put her thumb in her mouth when thinking. She
did so upon this occasion, as she sat wrapped in her reflections, <span
class="persName">Lallagagog,</span> who had been drowning flies in the
cream, and amusing himself in other kindred ways, now turned his
attention to <span class="persName">Belinda,</span> stepping up softly
behind her, he placed one great hand upon her head, the other under her
chin, and suddenly snapped her teeth together with a loud
laugh.</p>
	    <p><span class="persName">Lallagagog</span> did a worse
mischief than he had intended. His hands were so strong, and the little
white teeth so sharp, that <span class="persName">Belinda</span> was
placed in the awkward predicament of having bitten off her own
thumb.</p>
	    <p><span class="persName">Lallagagog</span> ran off and hid
himself, and poor <span class="persName">Belinda</span> retired,
weeping, to her chamber to bind up her mutilated hand 
	    <br/><span class="pagebreak">[manuscript page break]</span>
	    <br/>and invent an
excuse for not appearing at dinner; for she hardly liked to make her
first appearance before the <span class="persName">Borriballoo</span>
with a red nose and swollen eyes, and a bandaged hand.</p>
	    <p>She finally
pleaded a headache, a feeling of uncertainty and insecurity prompting
her not to complain of <span
class="persName">Lallagagog.</span></p>
	    <p>When <span
class="persName">the giant</span> saw her woebegone face, he very
readily excused her, saying that if such was her pleasure, he would make
all necessary arrangements himself.</p>
	    <p>Ambition and pride rose in
<span class="persName">Belinda’s</span> heart, she gave her full consent
to the proposed marriage.</p>
	    <p>In the evening, the giant said that the
<span class="persName">Grand Borriballoo</span> was perfectly satisfied
with the description and account given of the bride elect, and only
desired that she should be allowed to remain in strict seclusion until
the day of the ceremony, in accordance with the customs of his
ancestors.</p>
	    <p>Preparations for the wedding went on apace, and at
length the day arrived. The great hall of <span
class="persName">the giant’s mansion</span> was decorated with the most
elegant taste, and hundreds of brilliant lights flashed upon the jewels
and rich dresses of the guests.</p>
           <p>At opposite ends of the hall were
great doors. These were thrown open simultaneously. Through one entered
the <span class="persName">Grand Borriballoo</span> leaning upon the arm
of the priest, at the same moment that <span
class="persName">Belinda</span> supported by <span
class="persName">the giant</span> appeared at the other. <span
class="persName">Lallagagog</span> followed bearing her train.</p>
          <p>All eyes were turned towards <span class="persName">the bride;</span> but
she saw nothing but the <span class="persName">Grand Borriballoo,</span>
whom she now met for the first time. His carriage was majestic, and at
the same time of a very peculiar grace, caused doubtless by his having
three legs, instead of the usual number. His glittering tail was so

	    <br/><br/><span class="pagebreak">[manuscript page break]</span>
	    <br/><br/>long that as he
stood in the centre of the room its extremity reached to the entrance
where it was borne by five and twenty pages in gold and white. His heavy
locks of ferns and field flowers fell to his waist. His eye, placed in
the centre of his forehead, was large and lustrous and full. In short,
the most fastidious person could have taken no exception to his personal
appearance.</p>
          <p>A sudden hush and expectant thrill fell upon the vast
assembly as the <span class="persName">Grand Borriballoo</span> advanced
towards <span class="persName">Belinda,</span> tenderly took her hand,
gazed long and earnestly into her face, and signed the priest to
continue. Why will not the fates allow me to stop here, nor further
follow this tale which so suddenly changes to a scene of gloom and
horror.</p>
<p>As <span class="persName">Belinda,</span> blushing, raised
her hand to receive the ring from the <span
class="persName">Royal Borriballoo,</span> the priest gently said <span
class="said">“Your
right thumb, if you please; it is the law that only thus a Grand <span class="persName"></span>Borriballoo may marry."</span></p>
<p>Unconsciously <span
class="persName"></span>Belinda raised her maimed right hand.</p><p>The
priest shrank back with a cry of horror, and the <span
class="persName">Grand Borriballoo</span> fell to the floor in a
deathlike swoon.</p>
<p><span
	 class="said">“Ah I shall burst with mortification!”</span> Groaned
<span class="persName">the giant,</span> which he immediately did with a
loud report.</p>
<p>The guests fled in terror, some of them mortally
wounded.</p>
<p>The ring, which had dropped from the hand of the
bridegroom rolled along the floor to the feet of <span
class="persName">Lallagagog,</span> who shyly hid it in his mouth. It
stuck in his windpipe. In the confusion caused by his father’s explosion
he was unnoticed, and soon choked to death.</p>
<p>The whole proceedings
were so frightfully indecorous that 
	<br/><br/><span class="pagebreak">[manuscript page break]</span>
	    <br/><br/>the priest fell
into a rage, which was so deep that no ropes would reach him, where he
remains to this day.</p>
	    <p>The end of the <span
class="persName">Grand Borriballoo</span> was sad beyond belief. Knowing
his union with <span class="persName">Belinda</span> was now impossible,
he fell into a low state, weeping incessantly, neglecting the affairs
connected with his rank and office, which consequently fell into other
hands about whom his old friends rallied.</p>
	    <p>His society had become
so wearisome to those about him that he was left alone more and more, so
that when he had wept his eye out so one was aware of the piteous fact,
and he wandered for days in a thick wood adjacent to the castle vainly
seeking his way out. At last, glum and weary, suffering intolerably from
thirst and hunger, he sunk upon the ground.</p>
	    <p><span class="said">“Ah <span class="persName">Belinda”</span></span> moaned he, as he wiped the growing
cavern where his eye had been, with his tail, <span class="said">“would I had never beheld
		    thee!”</span> In his anguish he accidentally placed the end of his tail into
his mouth; unconsciously, in his delirium, assailed by the pangs of
hunger, he began devouring it, and absently ate himself up. No remains
were ever found except a few tail scales that his stomach was unable to
digest.</p>
	    <p>As to <span class="persName">Belinda,</span> no one knows
what became of her.</p></div>

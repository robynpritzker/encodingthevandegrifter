            <head type="title">The Hunchback</head>
            <p>A <name corresp="stevensonography.xml#boy"/> boy older than his appearance would
               indicate was sitting sullenly alone in the woods by the side of a stream. The water
               was clear and cool, flowers were blooming among the grass, the sky was blue, a gentle
               air was stirring. The day was heavenly, a calm and holy beauty pervaded all nature
               except the heart of this unfortunate boy.</p>
            <p>And yet he deserved some communication, for he seemed to be deformed. An elaborate
               contrivance of straps and buckles passed around his shoulders, which appeared to be
               hunched in a peculiar fashion. Years ago, when <seg
                  corresp="stevensonography.xml#boy">a lovely child</seg> with a face and temper
               like an angels <!-- missing punctuation and apostrophe here --> his <name
                  corresp="stevensonography.xml#parents">parents,</name> worthy people, had
               discovered that there was something <span ana="stevensonography.xml#wonder">strange
                  and unusual</span> in his appearance totally unlike that of other children. They
               were decent folk, and <span ana="stevensonography.xml#wonder">nothing had happened in
                  their family for many generations out of the usual course.</span> All the men were
               straight and tall, married comely and excellent housewives, and reared large families
               of the most eminent respectability. In short, lived and died in the regular orthodox
               fashion. The <span ana="stevensonography.xml#gothic">distress and horror</span> of
               all the relatives may be imagined when the unsightly protuberance was first noticed.
               The <name corresp="stevensonography.xml#boy">lad</name> was pitied by his <seg
                  corresp="stevensonography.xml#parents">parents,</seg> and scoffed at by his
               brethren, all alike as two peas.</p>
            <p>The physicians of his native place said <said who="physicians"
                  toWhom="stevensonography.xml#parents" direct="false" aloud="true">“Let <seg
                     corresp="stevensonography.xml#boy">the child</seg> alone; give him some active
                  useful employment and trust to him. Don’t use too much force, for the <persName
                     corresp="stevensonography.xml#boy">boy</persName> is of more delicate clay than
                  the rest, and must be managed carefully.”</said> But the parents in their <seg
                  ana="stevensonography.xml#fear">anxiety,</seg> the father being what is called a
               man handy with tools, had invented this <span ana="stevensonography.xml#gothic">cruel
                  arrangement of straps and buckles which seemed to have cut into the very soul of
                  the <persName corresp="stevensonography.xml#boy">boy</persName>.</span> He grew
                  <seg corresp="stevensonography.xml#grief">gloomy and despondent,</seg> dull at his
               books, and took no apparent pleasure in the society of others of his age. The burden
               seemed to grow with his years, to lie as heavily on his heart as on his shoulders. </p>
            <pb/>
            <p>This perfect summer day he had wandered off, as usual, by the banks of the little
               stream. His brother had gone further up where the water was deeper, and trout were
               said to be in the pools. At times their <span corresp="stevensonography.xml#joy"
                  >laughter came floating down so merry and infectious that a smile almost reached
                  the lips</span> of <seg corresp="stevensonography.xml#boy">the dull boy</seg> who
               stood brooding over the water.</p>
            <p>The wind rose somewhat, shaking down the autumn leaves in a shower at his feet,
               brown, crimson and gold. The heavy eyes brightened at the sight with a sudden light,
               like distant lightning after a tropical day. A <persName
                  corresp="stevensonography.xml#bird">brown bird</persName> began singing over his
               head as it swung on a bough. Softly as <!-- check this isn't meant to be "at" -->
               first, then louder and stronger and fuller, such a <span
                  corresp="stevensonography.xml#joy">wild joyous rollocking ron de lay that the boy
                  felt his pulses quicking and his heart pounding with the harmony</span>. The wind
               came stronger, with a breath of the sea. The song of the <name
                  corresp="stevensonography.xml#bird">brown bird</name> filled all the air. The
                  <name corresp="stevensonography.xml#boy">boy</name> stood upright, and with eager
               hands tore furiously at the ligatures that bound his shoulders. Buckles and straps
               parted and fell rattling to the ground. <span ana="stevensonography.xml#wonder">A
                  very curious thing happened. Released from their bonds, two great wings of purple
                  and gold quivered in the sunlight. A beauty not of the earth shone in the face of
                  the <name corresp="stevensonography.xml#boy">boy</name>, with a quick glance
                  upward he thrust aside the overhanging leaves, pushed the air with his burnished
                  wings and swept away towards the east.</span> The <name
                  corresp="stevensonography.xml#bird">brown bird</name> looked up, ceased its song,
               and hid its head beneath its wing.</p>
            <p>The next day, flying over the marshes to meet <seg
                  corresp="stevensonography.xml#bird">its</seg> love, in a bare and desolate place
                  <seg corresp="stevensonography.xml#bird">it</seg> discerned a gleam of color.
                  <span ana="stevensonography.xml#gothic">Swooping down to examine closer a thing so
                  unusual it found <name corresp="stevensonography.xml#boy">the poor boy</name> dead
                  and cold in the slump of the marsh. The muscles of his wings for so many years
                  unused to action had become flaccid and weak. <span
                     ana="stevensonography.xml#wonder">In his elation at the discovering of his
                     marvellous powers he had miscalculated his strength, attempted too high a
                     flight, and thus failed miserably in this outset of his career,</span> and so
                  had <span ana="stevensonography.xml#gothic">died in the mire, the green ooze
                     rising about his face and his purple wings trailing broken and
                  soiled.</span></span></p>

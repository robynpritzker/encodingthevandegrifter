			<p>A weak minded <span class="persName">sheep</span> and her <span
		class="persName">lamb</span> once lived on a bit of barren land; there were several small
		spots where clover grew, and a little shelter of old brush. They were not well cared for,
		but they made the best of what they had, and were reasonably happy. One day a <span class="persName">she-wolf</span>
		brought over to their place, from her own green fields, several sheep from her flock;
		they devoured all the clover that was the only <span
		class="overstrike">subsistence</span><span class="add">⟨sustenance⟩</span> of the <span
		class="persName">sheep</span> and <span class="persName">lamb,</span> and carelessly threw over their shelter of
		boughs.</p>

		<p>It sounds odd that a she-wolf should have charge of a flock; but this was a wily she-
	wolf; there were many wolves in the forest, and game was scarce and shy, so she got a place
	with a <span class="persName">shepherd</span> as a sheepdog. The <span class="persName">shepherd</span> was blind, and old, and foolish, and never knew
	the imposture. The neighbours, who were reluctant to meddle in other people’s affairs, did
	not like, or did not choose to tell him; so the <span class="persName">she-wolf</span> and her cubs waxed fast and strong,
	while her kinsmen of the forest, gaunt and hungry roamed

		<br/><br/><span class="pagebreak">[manuscript page break]</span><br/><br/>

		about, seeking their prey.</p>
		
		<p>It was not that she particularly wished to harm the
	<span class="persName">sheep</span> and <span class="persName">lamb<span> that the she-wolf robbed them, but that her
	natural instincts inclining her to a guerrilla life occasionally overcame the teachings of
	civilization.</p>

		<p>It was hard upon the <span class="persName">sheep</span> and the <span class="persName">lamb.</span> A cold rain
	fell, and winter was not far off. Before the clover had started to grow again, the shivering
	<span class="persName">lamb</span> was dead. The <span class="persName">sheep</span> tried to warm it with her own body, but her wool was wet, and she,
	too, was starved with the cold; she could only watch her <span class="persName">lamb’s</span> innocent eyes grey, and its
	little legs stiffen, with a breaking heart. She could do nothing; she could not replace the
	shelter, nor could she make the grass grow again, though she would gladly have watered the
	grass with her blood, and torn the fleece from her back to keep the cold from the <span class="persName">lamb.</span></p>

		<p>When the <span class="persName">lamb</span> was dead it was thrown into a hole. The <span class="persName">sheep,
	</span> in her <span class="grief">grief, hoped and thought she might die too; but she was older and stronger and
	more used to hardship than the lamb, so, sad and lonely, she held on and endured the cold and
	the hunger. Most of the time she either stood gazing</p>

		<br/><br/><span class="pagebreak">[manuscript page break]</span><br/><br/>

		<p>at the hole where they had thrown her <span class="persName">lamb,</span> or wandered about the bare pasture where it
	had frisked and played in happier days. Once a <span class="persName">cub</span> of the <span class="persName">she-wolf</span> came that way; it was so
	plump, and sleek, and well cared for, that when the bereaved <span class="persName">sheep</span> looked upon it she felt
	her weak heart giving way because of the injustice of things, and in a mad rage chased the
	<span class="persName">wolf-cub</span> howling away to its <span class="persName">mother.</span></p>
	
	<p>The next day the <span class="persName">blind shepherd</span> came in a great
	rage to the <span class="persName">sheep. </span> The wolf-cub had come panting home with a
	fearful tale; the <span class="persName">sheep,</span> she said, had come at her with a mouth
	a yard wide, full of blood and foam; with eyes the size of dinner plates, from which shot
	blue and green flames, and with an awful, deafening roar like a wild lion.</p>

	<p>The <span class="persName">sheep</span> could not remember these details, but full of
trouble went off alone to think it over; and wondered if all this were really true, and she had
actually become a <span class="gothic">mad ravening sheep</span>.</p>

<p>Soon she met the <span class="persName">Haymaker</span>
who was fond of walking in paths and places where the shadows were heavy. He was called the <span
class="persName">Haymaker</span> because he was supposed to make hay while the sun shone. All
people went to him for advice, he was</p>

			<br/><br/><span class="pagebreak">[manuscript page break]</span><br/><br/>

			<p>accounted so very wise; he was thought to be wise because he had many books, and
		he looked solemn, and he often said <span class="said">“policy is better than honesty,” “don’t whistle too
		much for your pay,”<span> and other things that showed a profound intellect, and a habit of
		deep thought. When he demanded the reason of the <span class="persName">sheep’s</span>
		depression of mind, she, being in awe of so great a man, <span class="indirectsaid">told her
		story</span>.</p>

		<p><span class="said">“I must tell you what to do,”</span> said he.<span class="said">“Oh
	no!”</span> cried <span class="persName">the sheep</span> <span class="said">“you are so very
	respectable that it would never do that you should mix yourself up in the affairs of a silly
	sheep, and a beast of prey.”</span>

	<p>The <span class="persName">Haymaker</span> <span class="indirectsaid">insisted that she
listen to him, and be guided by him.</span></p>

		<p><span class="said">‘“But I know myself what is best for me,”</span> cried the <span
	class="persName">sheep.</span> <span class="said">“Let me go away off to some quiet place
	where I can be quite alone. There I may be able to recover my former tranquility of mind. As it is, I
fear I am in too dangerous a state to be allowed to roam about freely. It is a dreadful thing to
find out that one is a ravening sheep. How do I know, or how do you know, to what wild deed my
fevered mind may prompt me. Suppose I should suddenly spring upon the wild bull, drag him
to</span></p>

		<br/><br/><span class="pagebreak">[manuscript page break]</span><br/><br/>

		<p><span class="said">the ground, and tear his vitals from his quivering body."’</span>
	</p>

		<p><span class="said">“That would, indeed, be horrible,”</span> said the <span
	class="persName">Haymaker;</span> <span class="said">“but worse yet than that may
	happen.”</span><span class="said">“Worse than that!”</span> Cried the <span
	class="persName">sheep</span> in an awe-stricken voice.<span class="said">“Yes; there is a
	lower depth still,”</span> and he spoke in a voice as hollow and ghastly that a thrill went
	through the veins of the <span class="persName">sheep, and chilled her very heart.<span
	class="said">“Suppose the pigs and the grasshoppers should find it out?”</span></p>

	<p>With a cry of horror the sheep fell swooning upon the ground. <span
class="indirectsaid">She had never thought of that. In her ignorance and stupidity she had
thought nothing could be worse than to know one’s self to be a ravening sheep; but oh heavens!
That the pigs and the grasshoppers should know!</span></p>

		<p>Crushed and humiliated she was carried off to a small paddock by the sea; here she
	nibbled grass on the hillside, and trotted by the beach, and might have become reasonable,
	cheerful in her latter days, but for the awful dread that always lay like a stone in her
	heart, <span class="said">“Suppose the pigs and the grasshoppers should know.”</span></p>

	<p>The <span class="persName">Haymaker</span> came in time to dislike all thought or mention
of the <span class="persName">sheep;</span> for he, too, was terrified lest the pigs and
grasshoppers should know, and it should be whispered about that a man as staid and respectable as
he had once known a ravening sheep.</p>

title: XML Encoding with TEI
---

<p style="font-size: 18px"> This project has encoded its files using the Text Encoding Initiative Consortium (TEI-C) guidelines for eXtensible Markup Language, or XML. Encoding the Vandegrifter follows in the footsteps of many other initiatives and projects which have used TEI not only to introduce previously-unknown texts, but also to evaluate familiar texts in new ways. For some examples, see the <a href="https://tei-c.org/activities/projects/">TEI projects</a> website. To display these short stories most effectively on this site, our XML files have been transformed and adapted into HTML files, but the full XML encoding can be found just below this paragraph. If you're reading our XML, you may notice references to the "stevensonography", which is a separate file documenting the lists of people, characters, places, and analytical terms used to encode these stories. The full "stevensonography" is also available below, at the bottom of the list.</p>

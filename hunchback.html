<p>A <span class="persName">boy</span>	older than his appearance would indicate
was sitting sullenly alone in the woods by the side of a stream. The water was clear and cool,
flowers were blooming among the grass, the sky was blue, a gentle air was stirring. The day was
heavenly, a calm and holy beauty pervaded all nature except the heart of this unfortunate
boy.</p>

<p>And yet he deserved some communication, for he seemed to be deformed. An elaborate
contrivance of straps and buckles passed around his shoulders, which appeared to be hunched in a
peculiar fashion. Years ago, when <span>a lovely child</span> with a face and temper like an
angels	his <span class="name">parents,</span> worthy people, had discovered that there was
something strange and unusual in his appearance totally unlike that of other children. They were
decent folk, and nothing had happened in their family for many generations out of the usual
course. All the men were straight and tall, married comely and excellent housewives, and reared
large families of the most eminent respectability. In short, lived and died in the regular
orthodox fashion. The distress and horror of all the relatives may be imagined when the unsightly
protuberance was first noticed. The <span class="name">lad</span> was pitied by his
<span>parents,</span> and scoffed at by his brethren, all alike as two peas.</p>

<p>The physicians of his native place said <span class="said">“Let <span class="persName">the child</span> alone; give him some
active useful employment and trust to him. Don’t use too much force, for <span
class="persName">the boy</span> is of more delicate clay than the rest, and must be managed
carefully.”</span> But the parents in their <span class="unsure">anxiety,</span> the father being what is
called a man handy with tools, had invented this cruel arrangement of straps and buckles which
seemed to have cut into the very soul of the <span class="persName">boy</span>. He grew
<span class="grief">gloomy and despondent,</span> dull at his books, and took no apparent pleasure in the
society of others of his age. The burden seemed to grow with his years, to lie as heavily on his
heart as on his shoulders.</p>

<br/><br/><span class="pagebreak">[manuscript page break]</span><br/><br/>

<p>This perfect summer day he had wandered off, as usual, by the banks of the little stream. His brother had gone further up where the water was
deeper, and trout were said to be in the pools. At times their laughter came floating down so
merry and infectious that a smile almost reached the lips of <span class="persName">the dull boy</span> who stood
brooding over the water.</p>

<p>The wind rose somewhat, shaking down the autumn leaves in a shower
at his feet, brown, crimson and gold. The heavy eyes brightened at the sight with a sudden light,
like distant lightning after a tropical day. A <span class="persName">brown bird</span> began
singing over his head as it swung on a bough. Softly as	 first, then louder and stronger and
fuller, such a wild joyous rollocking ron de lay that <span class="persName">the boy</span> felt his pulses quicking and his
heart pounding with the harmony. The wind came stronger, with a breath of the sea. The song of
the <span class="persName">brown bird</span> filled all the air. <span class="persName">The boy</span>
stood upright, and with eager hands tore furiously at the ligatures that bound his shoulders.
Buckles and straps parted and fell rattling to the ground. A very curious thing happened.
Released from their bonds, two great wings of purple and gold quivered in the sunlight. A beauty
not of the earth shone in the face of <span class="persName">the boy</span>, with a quick glance
upward he thrust aside the overhanging leaves, pushed the air with his burnished wings and swept
away towards the east. The <span class="persName">brown bird</span> looked up, ceased its song, and
hid its head beneath its wing.</p>

<p>The next day, flying over the marshes to meet
<span class="persName">its</span> love, in a bare and desolate place it discerned a gleam of color.
Swooping down to examine closer a thing so unusual it found <span class="persName">the poor
boy</span> dead and cold in the slump of the marsh. The muscles of his wings for so many years
unused to action had become flaccid and weak. In his elation at the discovering of his marvellous
powers <span class="wonder">he had miscalculated his strength, attempted too high a flight,</span> and thus failed miserably
in this outset of his career, and so had <span class="gothic">died in the mire, the green ooze rising about his face
and his purple wings trailing broken and soiled.</span></p>

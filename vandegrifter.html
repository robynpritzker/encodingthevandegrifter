<p>This project aims to shift attention on Stevenson from biography to literary output, considering her within the context of other late nineteenth century American women writers. Stevenson’s archives comprise boxes on boxes of records held in the National Library of Scotland, the Yale University Library, and the California State Park Archives, as well as the independent Robert Louis Stevenson Museum in St. Helena where these manuscripts are held. </p>

<p>Stevenson has always occupied a metamorphic, ambiguous space in critical and literary historical memory. As Roslyn Jolly notes, </p>

<p style=“font-style: italic”>Biographers have presented wildly contrasting portraits of Fanny Stevenson. She was a skilled and devoted nurse who repeatedly saved her husband’s life; she was a hypochondriac who selfishly competed with him for the attention given to invalids. She protected him from the social demands made by his London literary circle; she was jealous of the friends of his youth and bachelor days and deliberately set out to alienate him from them. She was a wonderful emotional and professional support; she was a terrible emotional and financial drain. (22) </p>

<p>Yet, in none of the various accounts, positive or negative, of Stevenson’s life, is she considered a writer or artist, despite both of those occupations being her lifelong interests. At most, critics and biographers, including Jolly, Heather Waldroup, and Stevenson’s sister, Nellie Van de Grift Sanchez, consider her a storyteller. As Waldroup explains in an article about Stevenson’s sociological activities, “Stevenson certainly takes pleasure in describing, in the telling of a story … her life experience gave her a knack for interpreting and explaining narratives around her” (13). My experience of reading Stevenson’s letters in her archive bears this out, as her dry wit, and ability to capture captivating anecdotes is clear. </p>

<p>For example, Stevenson notes in a diary entry from 1894 that a guest at their home in Apia, Samoa, had been particularly irritating. Stevenson describes the problematic visitor, “the Frenchman,” with her characteristic sarcasm. Though the man may have been “quite clever in many ways,” he is reportedly “beyond measure wearisome with long complicated boastful stories about himself, most of them patently false.” Though the man calls himself “a dreamer,” Stevenson muses, “I think him a nightmare.” An entry from several days later recounts the Frenchman telling an improbable story of how he once shot a Jewish man in the back, because his very appearance rendered the Frenchman nervous: the visitor says it was a “very laughable” occurrence. Despite Louis asking Stevenson to promise that she would not show her dislike in front of the man, whom Louis had found “very interesting and amusing,” Stevenson cannot refrain from saying to the man, “I do not believe your story; if I did either you or I should leave this house” (1894). Her letters and diaries are full of such compelling reflections, but have seldom been critically acknowledged, especially those from before the famous Stevenson family voyage to––and settlement in––Samoa.</p>

<p>Every scholar and writer presents wildly different conceptions of how Stevenson impacted those around her. Stevenson’s sister, Nellie Van de Grift Sanchez, affirms more generously than others the potential which Stevenson displayed through her literary accomplishments, considering that, if her sister had not chosen to “devote her time and strength to … the support and encouragement of others, there is no saying how far she might have gone, for she had an active, creative imagination, and a discriminating, critical judgment of style” (327). In one evocative description, Sanchez calls her a “sort of spiritual X-ray” capable of discerning someone’s character almost immediately (Sanchez 316). Accordingly, “her dislike of deceit and treachery was one of the most strongly marked traits in her character” (321). Sanchez figures Stevenson as containing “many strange contradictions,” and notes that even years into friendships she could reveal some “unexpected contrast” (323). Though old-fashioned, she was adaptable, and once she had the vote, “her family was amused to see her go to the polls and vote and carefully advise the men employed on her place concerning their ballots” (323). Yet all her life she was plagued by “harassing anxieties” (53). She was shy, and she did not like to talk about her own achievements, and would likely never have asserted her right to be considered an author. </p>

<p>Henry James’s letters suggest that Stevenson’s unpredictability and fierceness were a key part of what drew him to her in their decades-long friendship, which lasted beyond the death of Mr. Stevenson.[9] Mackay maintains that Stevenson always appreciated James’s novels more ardently than Louis did, probably because “she understood them more deeply under the skin” due to her complicated relationship with her American identity (135). Rumours have long circulated surreptitiously, often conveniently free of citation, that various stories and novels by James, some quite celebrated, took the Stevensons as inspiration for some of his characters: he was reportedly “fascinated” by the Stevensons’ marriage, visiting them regularly with his sister Alice, and the two families reportedly admired each other “for qualities opposite to their own” (Mackay 142-144). Whatever the perspective of outsiders, however, Louis described his marriage as “the most successful in the world” (Sanchez 108; Jolly 22). The two regularly collaborated, either on plays, their 1885 volume /The Dynamiter/, or on more daily tasks such as scribing, rewriting, or editing.</p> 

<p>There is little evidence in Stevenson’s archives about her relationship with her own writerly identity. In her introductions to Louis’s volumes and in her letters, she deflects this issue and avoids self-reflection. One brief glimpse into her perspective on the literary market comes in a letter to her mother-in-law, Margaret Stevenson, in March 1881. Stevenson’s son Lloyd was under the tuition of several scholars at the time, and Stevenson writes with a great concern for his future, “So far he seems to show no bent for anything more than literature, and that is an uncertain reed to lean upon” (1881.015). The “uncertain reed” of public authorship, however, did not stop Stevenson from writing on her own terms. In her introduction to Stevenson’s travel journal /The Cruise of the Janet Nichol/, Jolly draws attention to a letter to Sidney Colvin written in May 1889, in which Stevenson details her frustration with Louis’s equivocation in writing a volume on their Pacific travels. Stevenson laments that with her “own feeble hand” she could “write a book that the whole world would jump at” (39). Yet, in Stevenson’s own preface to /Janet Nichol/, she declares that the whole diary was “only intended to be a collection of hints to help [her] husband’s memory” as he wrote his own accounts (49). </p>
      
<p>She continues with the warning that “consequently, it frequently happened that incidents given in [her] diary were re-written (to their great betterment), amplified, and used in his.” The tension between Stevenson’s claim in her letter to Colvin and the latter qualifications and modesty, gives some indication of the many sacrifices Stevenson made in her own writing in order to support the literary ambitions of her husband. The image of Louis rewriting and appropriating Stevenson’s experiences as his own is an apt symbol of her literary career on the whole, which has for so long been obscured by her husband’s legacy. This project serves to intervene into these imbalances and amplify Stevenson’s unpublished writing for the first time, as part of an under-acknowledged tradition of late nineteenth century women’s writing. </p>

<p>[9: James wrote to Edmund Gosse on 28 September 1911, “I have treasures of lurid revelations for you, both oral and documented, about Fanny Stevenson … such as these celibate walls alone may listen to!” (James 1911). ]</p>
